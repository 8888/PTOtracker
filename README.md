# PTOtracker
This is a web-based program to track the basic usage of used paid time-off.

# Design and Features
PHP is used to generate the HTML tables and communicate with a mySQL database. Date calculations are perfromed in javascript. The program uses logins and database-stored hashed passwords. There is a session manager to confirm that there is always an authorized user or else you are directed to a login page. An add-user function is available upon login to create additonal user names and hashed passwords.
